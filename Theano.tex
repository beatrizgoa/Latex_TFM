\section{Programming language and frameworks}
The  programming language which has been used to develop the thesis is Python. Python is a object-oriented language and very used nowadays. The version used is the 2.7.\\

Python libraries have been used to help to develop the code. The main framework used is Theano. Theano has been used yo build the convolutional neural network and its training procedure because of the possibility that offers of working with symbolic variables, mathematical expressions and multidimensional arrays. Theano documentation could be found in \url{http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/}.\\

Scikit-learn is another Python library which has been used as the basis of building the classifiers and some of the metrics. Its documentation it is available in the following url \url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/}.\\

Others libraries as NumPy or Matplotlib have been used. NumPy is a library that allows users to works with multidimensional arrays or random simulations among others qualities. The documentation of this framework is available in \url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/}. Matplotlib has been used as graphic tool to show graphs.\\
