\section{Conclusions}
%Importante of the database
The importance of having a representative and well-build database is essential to train any classifier or neural network, because it is the main tool which classifiers or neural networks have to use. In the used databases, it has been proved that the quality of images is important to extract the features better and minimize the error. The results used with the FRAV database were better than CASIA database (for example) and one reason is the quality of images.\\
%Why does not work
Continuing with databases, the need of having a balanced database has been raised. If the database is composed by 70\% class 1 samples and 30\% class 2 samples, just if the classifier classify all the samples as class 1, the error will be the 30\%, so the classify would learn better to classify one class samples. This problem has appeared in experiments, mainly with MFSD database. There are different ways to try to minimize unbalanced databases, the first one would be get more samples from the class which has less samples. There not work if more samples of the less-samples class are obtained from the existing one, because if samples are repeated the classifier would learn them and over-fitting would be obtained.\\

%Best database and combination
From results it is possible to see that FRAV database is the most well-classified, the main reason is the quality of images. For example, MFSD-MSU database has been built with the camera of a smartphone and a laptop and FRAV database has been built with a professional camera.\\

%Best combination
The best model combination of CNN + classifier is obtained when RGB+NIR FRAV database feature level. This best result is a perfect classification with logistic regression and with Decision Tree too. RGB+NIR FRAV database classification level results are also outstanding, specially when LDA has been used for each classify because just one sample has been misclassified, the same sample and two samples has been misclassified with LDA + logistic regression.\\

%Best classifier
SVM with RBF kernel is, in general, the classifier that work best along the databases, although with this classifier has not gotten the best result. SVM is a classifier that works good with bi-class problems. However, it has not been possible to classify correctly, most of the time, when SVM with linear kernel has been used.\\

%LDA and PCA
With respect to use LDA or PCA reduction dimensionality methods none fundamental conclusion has been obtained, in some cases one works better than others, so it is not a waste of time trying to use it if the resources are available, because results could be improved.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item From \cite{PCAvsLDA}: when a small (or non-representative) training data set is used, there is no guarantee that LDA will outperform PCA (esto deberia de compararse con los resultados que se obtinen y parafrasear la frase si es necesario).
\item Best results with FRAV because of the quality of images
\item A balanced database and which more samples would reproduce better results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}
First trying to minimize the unbalanced database, like it is not possible to get more samples, change the error in that way that the network does not be penalized as much as will be during training if a sample of the less-samples class  is misclassified.\\

It would be interesting test the neural network and the classifier which works the best in a database with other databases. \\
