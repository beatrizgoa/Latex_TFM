\section{Conclusions}
In this section the conclusions obtained along the mothodology and results are presented and discused.

\begin{itemize}
\item From \cite{PCAvsLDA}: when a small (or non-representative) trianing data set is used, there is no guarantee that LDA will outperform PCA (esto deberia de compararse con los resultados que se obtinen y parafrasear la frase si es necesario).
\item Best results with FRAV because of the quality of images
\item A balanced database and which more samples would reproduce better results.
\end{itemize}
