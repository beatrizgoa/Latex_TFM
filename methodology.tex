\section{Algorithm diagram chart}
The flowchart of the algorithm developed in \ref{sec:adapt_lenet} is represented in figure X . The code has been run as described in the figure as many times as databases are availables (CASIA images, CASIA videos, RGB FRAV, RGB+NIR feature level FRAV, RGB+NIR classification level FRAV and MFSD-MSU).\\

The diagram used to obtain the data (the explained in \ref{subssec:ejec1_database}) and feed the network is represented in figure X. The same process has been carried out for each database.\\
