\section{Algorithm diagram chart}
The flowchart of the code used for this thesis development in section \ref{sec:adapt_lenet} is shown in \ref{fig:flowchart}. In the figure, the subsets generation flowchart from the databases is presented in \ref{fig:dat_flowchart}; it has been used for each database (CASIA images, CASIA videos, RGB FRAV, RGB+NIR feature level FRAV, RGB+NIR classification level FRAV and MFSD-MSU). The programmed code is summarized in figure \ref{fig:alg_flowchart} which has been run, as described in the figure, as many times as databases are available.
