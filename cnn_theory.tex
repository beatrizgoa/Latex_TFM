\section{Neural Network background theory}
In this section, the basis and the theoretical background of the convolutional neural networks theory is exposed.\\

\subsection{Historical introduction}
The historical introduction to neural networks is going to be summarized \cite{BINN}:

Neural Networks are introduced by first time in the years 40 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, more specifically, simple models of neural networks (switches based on neurons) were able to calculate almost every arithmetic problems and logic operations. Few years layer, the recognition of spacial patters field was defined as a interesting scope for neural networks.\\

In 1949 the `Hebbian rule' was postulate by Donald O. Hebb. The rules describes the generalized learning basis of neural networks. This rule explain that two connected neurons have  a bigger strength if they are active at the same time, and the strength changes proportionally to the product of the two activities.\\

From 1951, the golden age of neural networks start although it stopped with a big pause. The first neurocomputer which was capable to adjust the weights by itself was developed in 1951 and was called \textit{Snark}. The fist neurocomputer able to recognize simple numbers was called \textit{`Mark I perceptron'} as was developed between 1957 and 1958.\\

It was in 1959 when Franck Rosenblatt  defined the \textit{perceptron} and the \textit{perceptron convergence theorem} was verified. One year later, the \textit{ADALINE (ADAptive LInear NEuron)} was developed, this was the first commercially used neural network which was a fast and precise system. One important characteristic was the \textit{delta rule} rule used for the training procedure. Before the golden age finished, researched figured out that the XOR function was not able to be solve with just one perceptron.\\

From these years, neural networks does not have much importance, until computational resources were enough. But some important advances were developed ad the \textit{linear associator} model (an associative memory model). The backpropagation of error, a very used learning procedure was defined in 1974 by Paul Werbos. \textit{The self-organizing feature maps} were described in 1982, there are also known as Kohonen maps. In 1983, a neural model able to recognize handwritten characters was developed as an extension of the Cognitron, the new model was called Neocognitron.\\

From this time on, neural networks are having a significant importance and are researched widely, it has to notice, that nowadays the computational resources are bigger than some years and that makes that the researchers could be more extensive.\\

\subsection{Introduction}
Humans, along the history, have tried to reproduce nature. Evolution, has turned out to be a big coordination in nature. If object recognition, associate concepts, memorize or extracting the semantic of images are focused, humans are provided of those processing information qualities. Trying to get those qualities with technology is a current (and not surprising) challenge.\\

One of the matters that is increasing its importance are neural networks which are inspired in biological neural networks. Neural networks are a important subject of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and it is a new way (and more sophisticated) of processing information \cite{Rojas}.\\

\subsection{Biological Neural Networks}
Biological neural networks are part of the nervous system and are formed by neurons units or nervous cells. Each neuron is a capable of process information in different ways by itself \cite{Rojas}.\\

The principal components of a neuron are the nucleus, dendrite, cell body, axon, schwann cell, the node of Ranvier... In figure \ref{fig:Bio-Neuron} a biologica neural is shown in which its components are signalized \cite{BINN}.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption{Biological Neural Network. Image obtained from \cite{BINN}} \label{fig:Bio-Neuron}
\end{figure}

The soma is the spherical central part of the nerve cell in whose there is a salt and potassium concentration which is covered by the neuronal membrane. Inside the soma is the neuronal nucleus and from the soma branches are extend (dendrites). Nerve cells are connected among them by dendrites. Neurons are transmitting and receiving nervous signals continuously, communicating among them. The information transference is produced, more specifically, in the synaptic clef (space between two neurons connection). This exchange of information is denominated synapses and it is made though electrochemical activities. The axon is a soma extension whose responsibility is transmitting the information electrochemical out of the neuron, by the nervous system thanks to its terminal branches \cite{BINN, neuroscience}\\

\subsection{Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)}
As the same way as the nervous systems is formed by neurons, artificial neural networks are composed by artificial neurons. Each artificial neuron is a processing unit whose input is processed and shared to another neuron or to the output. Neurons are connected among them \cite{BINN}\\

Basically, there are three types of artificial neurons:
\begin{description}[noitemsep,topsep=8pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=20pt]
\item \textbf{Input neurons}, if belong to the input layer. This neurons receive the input data of the network.
\item \textbf{Hidden Units}, if belong to the processing layers. There are many types of layers: convolutional, pooling, dropout... There could be as many hidden layers and hidden units as user desire. The connectivity and the topology of the layers define the topology of the network.
\item \textbf{Output neurons}, if belong to the output layer. This neurons gives the user the processed information.
\end{description}

In figure \ref{fig:esquemaneuronal} the schematic of a general neural network it is possible to visualize the schematic of a general neural network with an undefined number of neurons in each layer and an undefined number of hidden layers.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{images_miscelaneus/red_neuronal.jpg}
\caption{Schematic of a general neural network.} \label{fig:esquemaneuronal}
\end{figure}

A single neuron is formed by an input, a weight \textit{W} and a bias \textit{b} associated (Independent term). The value of the bias is always 1, but it has an associated weight that make that the value of the bias change. Weight and bias values could be modified. The output of the neuron is associated to an activation function. \\

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{images_miscelaneus/neurona_sencilla.jpg}
\caption{Simplest neural network architecture.} \label{fig:neuronasencilla}
\end{figure}

The simplest example of a neural network is formed by two inputs neurons and a output neuron as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:neuronasencila} in which \textit{$W=[w_1,w_2]$} are refered to the weights assigned to each neuron. The \textit{b} value is refered to the bias term. \textit{$X=[x_{1},x_{2}]$} are the input of the network architecture and \textit{y(x)} the output. The output is predetermined by the equation \ref{eq:ecuation_neuronasencilla}. So, the output would depend on the input, weights and bias sand the activation function (or transfer function) \textit{F} \cite{krose}. \\

%Ecuacion salida neurona
			\begin{equation}
			y(x)=F(\sum_{i=1}^{2} (w_{i}*x_{i} + b) )
			\label{eq:ecuation_neuronasencilla}
			\end{equation}\\


Due to activation function, the output of the neuron would change if the input is bigger than a some threshold. This threshold is defined by the own activation function. There are various functions that are used: sigmoid function, Heaviside function, Fermi function or hyperbolic tangent among others. In figure \ref{fig:activation_function} (which has been obtained from \cite{BINN}) the mentioned function are shown and the output would be 0 or 1 values if the function is sigmoid or Fermi and the output would be -1 or 1 if the function is an hyperbolic tangent. \\

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Analogies between ANN and Biological Neural Networks}
Analogies between Artificial and Biological Neural networks could be found (if both basic theory is known) because the first one (artificial NN) are based in the second one. It is easy to see that biological neurons correspond to artificial neurons. But the cell body correspond with transference function. The output to others neurons would correspond to the axon and synapses with weights and bias. The soma would correspond with the transfer function. Those analogies are summarized in table \ref{table:Analogias}. Artificial neural networks are just inspired in Biological neural networks, that both work in a different (although inspired) way must be made clear.\\

\end{tabular}  \caption{Analogies between artificial neural networks and biological neural networks} \label{table:Analogias}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Learning}
Neuronal networks are able to learn features from the input to classify or just extract features of the input data. In order to know how to get the desired output, a learning process is needed. The learning process what really do is modifying weights and bias values for each layer with the purpose of getting a better output \cite{NNDesign}.\\

There are three main different learning procedures that defined following \cite{NNDesign}:

\begin{description}[noitemsep,topsep=8pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=20pt]
	\item \textbf{Supervised Learning:} the input training data is given with its target (correct result of its corresponding sample), that means that the train samples has associated the desired output. The learning consist in adjust the weights and bias until the output of the network is the same or the closest value as the target.
	\item \textbf{Reinforcement Learning:} in the training, the correct target is not provided, but just a grade is given to the network.
	\item \textbf{Unsupervised Learning:} there is not help in the training, no target and no grade, just the input data. The networks learn to cluster the input data and the weights and bias changes in function of the bias.
\end{description}

All the learning procedures in neural networks have in common the modification of weights ans bias to learn and obtain the desired output, so the error at the output is minimized. The most useful learning procedure is the supervised learning, along this project this is the used.\\

Una manera de buscar ese m√≠nimo error en la red es utilizando el m√©todo del descenso del gradiente, $\mathit{\nabla}$.\\

El gradiente es una generalizaci√≥n de la derivada para funciones multidimensionales. Este m√©todo busca un m√≠nimo en pasos proporcionales en la direcci√≥n contraria al gradiente (negativo). El problema que plantea este m√©todo es encontrar en un m√≠nimo local en lugar de en un m√≠nimo global, a pesar de ser un m√≠nimo que proporciona un error aceptable puede existir un m√≠nimo en el gradiente que ofrezca un error menor. %\cite{DKriesel} \cite{understandConv}.
Tambi√©n hay que llegar a un compromiso entre el tama√±o de los pasos, ya que si son muy grandes te puedes saltar el m√≠nimo, y son muy peque√±os el coste computacional es mucho mayor al igual que el tiempo de procesado.\\

La retropropagaci√≥n del error o \textit{Backpropagation error} es un tipo de aprendizaje supervisado muy recurrido, en el que se sabe de antemano la salida deseada. Al tener salida deseada y la salida real de la red \textit{y(x)}, se puede calcular la funci√≥n del error que comete la red \textit{Err(w)} que va a ser usado, en funci√≥n de los pesos para entrenar la red para obtener la salida deseada m√°s aproximada posible.\\

El error \textit{E} que comete una red es la suma de los errores de cada muestra \textit{p}, $E^{p}$:

%Ecuacion error 1
\begin{equation}
E=\sum_{p}E^p = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{p}(\delta^p- y^p)^2
\end{equation}

El error total, se puede definir como el m√≠nimo cuadrado medio de la salida deseada y la salida real para cada muestra. El m√≠nimo cuadrado medio encuentra los valores de todos los pesos que minimizan la funci√≥n de error a trav√©s del descenso de gradiente. La idea es hacer un cambio en el peso proporcional al negativo de la derivada del error medido en el patr√≥n actual con respecto a cada peso %\cite{BKrose} \cite{DKriesel}.\\

La retropropagaci√≥n del error est√° basada en la regla delta generalizada o ``generalized delta rule''. En la retropropagaci√≥n del error se sabe la salida deseada de la red, calculando con la regla delta la adaptaci√≥n de los pesos, pero para aplicar esto a salida de las capas ocultas es necesario aplicar la regla de la cadena para adaptar los pesos de las capas ocultas ya que no se tiene el valor $\delta$ para estas capas. La regla de la cadena distribuye el error de una neurona de salida $y_o$ todas las neuronas ocultas con las que est√° conectadas, comparando la salida deseada $d_o$ y resultando en la se√±al error $\sigma_o$ Por lo que el peso de una conexi√≥n entre dos neuronas se puede expresar %\cite{BKrose} \cite{DKriesel}:\\

%Ecuacion backpropagation 1
			\begin{equation}
			\Delta_{p}W_{jk}=\gamma \delta _{k}^{p}y_{j}^{p}
			\label{eq:ecuation_back1}
			\end{equation}\\

Siendo  $\gamma$ la constante de aprendizaje, \textit{k} la unidad que recibe la entrada y salida de la neurona \textit{j}.\\

\subsubsection{Type of Layers}
The layers that conforms the networks could be different depending on the mathematical operation. The most common used layers are described above:
\begin{description}[noitemsep,topsep=8pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=20pt]
	\item \textbf{Convolutional layer:} In this type of layers, the convolution operator is processed at the input. Weights are the applying filters and the output are the features or characteristics useful to extract the information of the image. In one convolutional layer, there could be used as many filters are user defines.
	\item \textbf{Pooling Layer:} In this layer, the dimensionality is reduced. The most important information is preserved. It is usually used at the output of the convolutional to resume its out \cite{Doorn}. The most used pooling layer is the max-pooling layer, the maximum values are saved.
	\item \textbf{No-linearity layer: } Esta capa consta de una funci√≥n sigmoide punto tanh() aplicado a la entrada de la capa. Sin embargo, en las implementaciones recientes, se han utilizado otras no linealidades m√°s sofisticadas \cite{Lecum3, Doorn}.
	\item \textbf{Dropout layer:} Las neuronas de una arquitectura dise√±ada tienden a confiar en la salidas de unas neuronas espec√≠ficas, y esto provoca sobreajuste. La finalidad de esta capa es evitar este problema, para ello se omiten los valores de activaci√≥n a cero omitiendo temporalmente algunas neuronas en cada caso de entrenamiento. De este modo, las neuronas se vuelven m√°s adaptativas y menos restrictivas a la arquitectura. Otra forma similar de evitar el problema es utilizar \textbf{``DropConnect''}, donde en lugar de eliminar las neuronas, son los pesos los que se ponen a cero \cite{Doorn}.\\
	\item  \textbf{Fully-connected layer:} La finalidad de esta capa es usada para la clasificaci√≥n basada en las caracter√≠sticas que se han ido computando en la red %\cite{understandConv}.
\end{description}

El rendimiento de las redes est√° determinado por muchos factores interrelacionados arquitect√≥nicos; Entre ellos est√°n el n√∫mero de capas, dimensiones de los mapas de caracter√≠sticas, extensiones del kernel espaciales, el n√∫mero de par√°metros y tama√±os de agrupaci√≥n y la colocaci√≥n de las capas %\cite{LeCum2}.

\subsection{Type of Networks}

\begin{description}[noitemsep,topsep=8pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=20pt]
	\item \textbf{Siamese:}
	\item \textbf{Convolutional:}
	\item \textbf{Recurrent:}
\end{description}

\section{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}
Convolutional neural network are a determinate typology of neural network, CNN are inspired in how the visual cortex of a cat works \cite{Doorn}. This type of neural networks are (usually) used with images at input.\\

Convolutional neural network has been used successfully in recognition and classification task includying document and object recognition, face detection, robotics navegation... \cite{Lecum2, Lecum3}.
 Una red de convoluci√≥n consiste en m√∫ltiples capas de bancos de filtros seguido de no linealidad y la agrupaci√≥n espacial. En la figura %\ref{convnet} se puede ver un esquema simplificado de las redes neuronales %\cite{Farabet}. \\
