\section{Introduction}
This document is about detecting and recognize spoofing attacks in images. In order to do that, it is going to be used convolutional neural networks and several images databases.\\

To get that goal, a convolutional neural network has been developed in python using Theano library.\\

Theano is a Python library that allows you to work with mathematical expressions and work with symbolic variables, moreover, Theano handles multidimensional arrays, like Numpy.\\

There are numerous open-source deep-libraries that have been built on top of Theano, for example Keras, Lasagne and Blocks.\\

Theano is not the unique language oriented to deep learning, for example Google, has developed its deep learning language called TensorFlow; Caffe and Torch are others examples.\\
