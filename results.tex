In this chapter the results obtained are presented as well as the training process that is going to be discussed. The hole proccess (training and testing has been realized three times to have more general results.


\section{Training and validating process}
The convolutional neural networks has been trained independently for each database.  Due to the fact that the training process has been realized 

\subsection{CASIA Image database}

\subsection{CASIA Video database}

\subsection{FRAV database}

\subsection{FRAV RGB+NIR (feature level) database}

\subsection{FRAV RGB+NIR (classification level) database}

\subsection{MFSD database}


\section{Testing process}
From the best CNN model, for each database, A SVM (with lineal and RBF kernel), KNN, Decision Tree and logistic regression has been trained. Also the testing has been realize after training a LDA with each classifier and PCA with each classifier. The results are going to be exposed independently of each database and then compared among all databases.\\
