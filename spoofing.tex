\section{Anti-spoofing}
At the same time as technology advance, capture systems and processing algorithms have proceed too. This open huge of quantity the doors and options and one of them is the capability of developed more sophisticated identification systems, giving way to biometrics systems.\\

\subsection{Introduction}
The need to get characteristics from people to identify them appeared in the 1870s when Alphonse Bertillon measures doby parts as skull diameter and arm and foot length to identify prisoners in USA until the 1920s. There were in the 1880s when fingerprint and facial identification were proposed. But with the appearance of digital signals processing systems in 1960, the voice and the fingerprint biometric systems were started to be investigated and researches started to think to use this system to identification in access control security. Ten years later, the geometry of the hand was started to be a field of interest for automated technologies of identification. The retina and signature verification appeared in the 80s and after a short time the face systems. The last biometrics systems appeared in the 1990s with the iris recognition\cite{Intro_biometrics}.\\
