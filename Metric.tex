\section{Metrics}
In this section, the metrics that have used to express the results are going to be shown and explained.

\subsection{Cost and Error}
The first parameter that is used is the cost. The cost is used while the neural network is training. The lower value, The better performanceof the networok.

More specifically, for training the neural ne

\subsection{True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN)}
True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN) are metrics that are used for bi-classes problems.

\subsection{ROC curve}

\subsection{Precision and Recall}

\subsection{APCR and BPCR}
