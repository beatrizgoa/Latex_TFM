\emph{In this chapter, the theoretical basis of anti-spoofing and convolutional neural networks are exposed in order to understand the whole document. In addition, the classifiers used and the metrics to compare them are defined in this chapter as well as the databases that are going to be used to train and test the CNN and classifiers.}
