\section{Presentation Attack detection (PAD)}

Automated determination of a presenation attack. PAD is a componenent of biometric system (sacado de PDF de metrics).\\

Some examples of PAD are artefaction detection, alered biometric detection... (del pdf de antes)\\

Anti-spoofing, biometric fraud, spoof detection are some others terms that are used. (tambien del pdf de antes).\\



\section{Matching performancec metrics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Falsematch rate (FMR):percentage of fingerprint pairs from different people (imposters) that match.
\item False non-match rate (FNMR): percentage of fingerprint pairs from the same person/finger (genuine) that do not match 
\item True match rate (TMR): TMR = 100 –FNMR

\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Normal Presentation Classification Rate (NPCR): percentage of normal presentations (live fingerprints) that are accepted as normal presentations.
\item Attack Presentation Classification Rate (APCR): percentage of attack presentations (spoof fingerprints) correctly classified as attack presentations
\item Attack presentation error rate (APER): percentage of attack presentations that are accepted as normal presentations (100 – APCR)
\end{itemize}

\section{Confusion Matrix}


\section{FAR and FRR}
FAR: Error that is produced by aceptation.\\
FRR: Error that is produced by rejection.\\
ERR: Equal error rate: Is the value when FAR(\%) = FRR(\%). It is very used in papers.\\
TRR: True rejection rate.\\
TAR: True aceptacion rate.\\
FRR = (1-TRR)\\
TAR = (1-FAR)\\

\subsection{ROC curves}
It is repesented FRR and TAR, also can be visualized the EER.\\
