\section{Introduction}
Convolutional neural networks are a variant of Multilayer Perceptron, one difference is that convnets are biologically inspired in the visual cortex of cats, therefore networks are used to classify images because of the fact that it can extract and learn features of images; however, to classify new images is needed a classifier at the output of the net.\\

Convolutional neural networks are a package of different layers, in those layers the features of the training images are extracted and learnt by the net. There are different kinds of layers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Convolutional layer
	\item Pool layer
	\item non linearity
	\item Fully-Connected Layer
\end{itemize}

Each layer is integrated by a set of independent neurons.  Each neuron is formed by the following elements:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item An input: the input could be a single input or a set of inputs.
	\item Weights: each input is associated with a weight
	\item Bias:  the bias is an independent term which is associated with its neuron.
	\item Activation function
	\item An output
\end{itemize}
